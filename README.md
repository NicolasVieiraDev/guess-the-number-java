# Guess the Number — Java CLI

A number guessing game developed in Java and executed via terminal (CLI).  
The goal is to guess the secret number generated by the system within a range of 1 to 100, respecting the attempt limit defined by the selected difficulty level.

All rules are clearly presented at the beginning of the game, making the experience simple, intuitive, and straightforward.

Let’s see how sharp your intuition is today 🎯

The project was structured with a focus on clarity and single responsibility for each class:

- **Main**: Program entry point and main execution flow
- **Game**: Responsible for the game rules and core logic
- **User**: Stores player data and victory tracking
- **Difficulty**: Defines constant states for difficulty levels and attempt limits
